# PhD Thesis in Python

This is the python version of my phd research. 

The idea behind the research is to use Complex Networks dynamics and
structural properties based on features extracted from regions in images. Each
of these regions is an object.

The database used for training is the [SUN Database](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/SUN/).
